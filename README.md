# brau.beer
A PWA brewing application

This has been my on-and-off passion project, mostly used as a way of venting, trying out new technologies as they arrive in browsers. And the state of the code base clearly shows it. There are more things that doesn't work than actually works. I've been putting off publishing this until I feel that it is "ready", but I've grown to realise that this "ready" is always going to be "later", never "now". Maybe the public shame of having something that doesn't work will be the kick in the derriere I need to make it something that works.


## Running
Install prereqs. I'll update this as soon as I remember all of them. `yarn install` and hope for the best I guess.


## Offline first
The goal here is to have the application live entirely server-less. No interaction with a server should be necessary after the initial load. Make use of service worker for assets, IndexedDB for all data input.


## Licence
Until I figure out the most correct one to use, I reserve copyright. I'll be "proper" open source at some point.
